## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

### **Important Note:** GraphRAG Local UI is barely 2 weeks old and is currently a major work in progress and building a UI around the GraphRAG library has introduced a number of challenges; mainly with the Indexing process. The query is also a work in progress as it tends to go between functional and breaking with the changes to the GraphRAG library. I am rethinking my approach to make this app more robust and modular, especially for scaling. Expect major changes over the next few weeks as things get worked out and more refined.
**Users should expect to encounter some bugs and breaking changes. I appreciate your patience and feedback during this development phase. If you encounter indexing issues while running this Gradio app while I am debugging it, you can typically run it straight in the terminal with the CLI args and have it work out 80-90% of the time.**

*While it is currently functional, it has only been primarily tested on a Mac Studio M2.*

My vision for GraphRAG Local UI is to become the ultimate GraphRAG app for local LLMs, incorporating as many cool features and knowledge graph tools as possible. I am continuously working on improvements and new features.

### Recent Updates
- [x] Indexing Works! Fixes to the Indexing process and caching of embeddings.
- [x] LLM agnostic: Use Ollama or set your own base URL and local model for LLM and Embedder
- [x] Custom configurable graph visuals
- [x] Preset Query/Indexing library options to quickly and easily harness all the GraphRAG args
- [x] Enhanced UI with tabbed interface for better organization
- [x] Improved file management system
- [x] Real-time indexing progress and control

### Upcoming Features
- [ ] Dockerfile for easier deployment
- [ ] Launch your own GraphRAG API server for use in external applications
- [ ] Experimental: Mixture of Agents for Indexing/Query of knowledge graph
- [ ] Support for more file formats (CSV, PDF, etc.)
- [ ] Web search/Scraping capabilities
- [ ] Enhanced error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Improved performance and scalability
- [ ] Advanced graph analysis tools
- [ ] Integration with popular knowledge management tools
- [ ] Collaborative features for team-based knowledge graph building

I am committed to making GraphRAG Local UI the most comprehensive and user-friendly tool for working with knowledge graphs and LLMs. Your feedback and suggestions are much needed in shaping the future of this project.

Feel free to open an Issue if you run into an error, and we will try to address it as soon as possible to minimize any downtime you might experience.

## Troubleshooting

- `No module named 'distutils'`: If you can't run `gradio app.py`, try running `pip install --upgrade gradio` and then exit out and start a new terminal. It should then load and launch properly as a Gradio app.

- On Windows, if you run into an encoding/UTF error, you can change it to the correct format in the YAML Settings menu.

- Indexing Errors: These are still tough to debug and track down as it is dependent on your specific pipeline of LLMs and embedders. Right now it seems to call /v1/embeddings no matter what in the Index workflow, but I think I found a workaround that allows Ollama and other local options. I'll keep trying to reinforce the Indexing process to make it more stable and robust.

For any issues or feature requests, please open an issue on the GitHub repository. Happy knowledge graphing!
