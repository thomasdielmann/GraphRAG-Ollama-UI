Specifically, they focus on addressing problems and functions rather than solely exploring natural aspects inspired by nature. Additionally, these Authors are experts in the field of biomimetics, offering tools, models, and guidelines for successful project implementation.\n\nNote: I have resolved any potential contradictions by maintaining a focus on both biomimicry-based approaches (problem-solving) and biomimetic expertise (tools, models, and guidelines).
