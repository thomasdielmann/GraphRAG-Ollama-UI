{"result": "The WEB OF SCIENCE is a comprehensive academic database designed to index and provide access to scholarly literature, encompassing articles, books, and conference papers. It serves as an essential tool for scientific research and analysis, utilized not only for creating bibliographic coupling maps but also for generating data for co-citation maps that illuminate trends in academic research. This resource is pivotal in the search for scientific literature, facilitating the exploration of various fields including biomimicry. WEB OF SCIENCE has been employed in international literature reviews, as seen in projects like TEMAC, to gather sources on emerging areas such as biomimicry, contributing significantly to the understanding and advancement of knowledge across disciplines.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
