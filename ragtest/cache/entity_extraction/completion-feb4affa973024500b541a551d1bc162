Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

The elastic modulus of a surface can also be calculated from force/distance curves produced by an AFM indenter [29]. Using this method, estimates of the elastic modulus of the external surface of the pad (the method does not provide information on deeper structures), are significantly higher, giving a median value of 5.7 MPa. Surface structures will thus have an increased resistance to wear. By contrast, the innermost layers, lying close to sub-dermal lymph spaces and a capillary network, have much lower elastic moduli and thus are extremely soft and pliable. Keratin filaments run inwards from the surface (figure 3) into the pad allowing the pad to maintain its shape in spite of the softness of the pad material [18,24,30,31].\n\n\n\n\n\npolygonal\n\n4\n\ntoe pad\n\nepithelial cells\n\nr\n\n............................................................... o\n\n( a)\n\n( b)\n\n( c)\n\nyalsociet\n\nypublishing\n\n.or\n\n100 mm\n\n5 mm\n\ng/journal/rsta\n\n( d )\n\n( e)\n\nPhil.Tran\n\n1 mm\n\n500 nm\n\ns.R.S\n\ntightly packed nanopillars (SEM and TEM)\n\noc.A37\n\nFigure 2.
