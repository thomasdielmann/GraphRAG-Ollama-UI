From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Insects may have hairy pads like geckos (e.g. beetles and flies) or smooth pads like tree frogs (e.g. cockroaches and grasshoppers) [19]. As there is fluid between pad and external surface, it has, until recently, been assumed that insects, like tree frogs, adhere by wet adhesion. However, Labonte & Federle [20]\n\nhave recently questioned this conclusion as their most recent data could be better explained by adhesion using van der Waals forces.\n\nIn this short review, we will discuss the complexities of the structure of tree frog toe pads in relation to their function as well as the development of artificial toe pad analogues. As we will make clear, studies of the properties of such artificial structures provide insights into the Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 09 July 2023\n\nfunctioning of actual toe pads as well as assisting the development of new smart adhesives based on tree frog adhesive and friction mechanisms. Additionally, we will describe some recent applications of the tree frog\u2019s mechanisms of adhesion and friction and discuss the current challenges and future perspectives of this exciting field of research.\n\n2. Tree/torrent frog adhesion\n\n(a) Toe-pad structure and function\n\nAdhesive toe pads are thought to have evolved separately by convergent evolution in several different families of frogs [21]. Most of these families are arboreal, living in trees or shrubs (tree frogs such as Hypsiboas boans (figure 1)). However, adhesive pads are also found in frogs living in the region of waterfalls (torrent frogs of the family Ranidae). The adhesive pads are located on\n\n\n\n( a)\n\n( b)\n\n3\n\nr\n\n............................................................... oyalsociet ypublishing\n\n.org/journal/rsta\n\nPhil.Trans.R\n\nhypsiboas boans\n\n.Soc.A\n\nFigure 1.
