CNT-based adhesives showed shear adhesion of approximately 100 N cm\u22122, 10 times higher than that of gecko foot-hairs [46]. The complicated fabrication process and the poor durability of CNT forest, however, hinder its future applications. By contrast, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which has a relatively low modulus, has been widely used to construct structured adhesives due to its handling simplicity and commercial availability.\n\nCompared to the flat surface, PDMS micropillar arrays showed a remarkable decrease in E eff, so that a larger AR results in a smaller E eff (figure 13 a, b). The decreased E eff results in a higher compliance to the contact surface, causing a higher elastic energy dissipation during pull-off from the surface [52]. For instance, increasing the AR of PDMS micropillar arrays from 0.5 to 4 increased pull-off forces by a factor of 3 [53]. It is worth mentioning that measurement of the E eff of a pillar array with a small AR (e.g. 0.5) could be influenced by its backing material. However, higher ARs are not always beneficial for adhesion enhancement. In the case of frog-inspired hexagonal pillars Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 09 July 2023\n\nwith height of H and side length of L (figure 13 c), the adhesion force was found to decrease when H/ L was increased from 0.75 to approximately 1.9 (figure 13 d) [54]. Similar adhesion dependence on the pillar AR was also reported by Iturri [55]. It was explained that the pillars tend to bend and cluster at a high AR, due to the small gap between pillars. The bending and clustering may contribute to the adhesion reduction in two possible ways: (1) the bending of pillars offers the pillar edge for contact, reducing the effective contact area; (2) the clustering of pillars may form a continuous area for contact, reducing the effect of contact splitting. Moreover, the contact density will be reduced by increasing the channel width W, resulting in a smaller adhesive force. This may explain why tree frog toe pads have a small pillar height and a small channel width.\n\nThough the adhesive toe pads on tree frogs and bush-crickets are normally called smooth adhesive pads,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "qwen2:7b", "temperature": 0.5, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 1024, "n": null}}
