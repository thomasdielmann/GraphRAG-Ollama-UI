Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

The mathematical equations relate the capillary attraction between the bodies to their elastic repulsion. Although they do not lend themselves to any easy calculation of the adhesive force, they are of interest in that they predict that FM scaling will gradually change from length scaling to area scaling with increasing r, this change occurring more rapidly for materials with a lower effective elastic modulus ( E eff).\n\nFor instance, in equation (2.7) which deals with the Laplace pressure component of adhesion, the first term is proportional to r and is identical to the force with a hard sphere (equation (2.4)), while the second term is proportional to r 2. It is negligible for high Young\u2019s moduli, but becomes significant for soft materials.\n\n\u03c0\u03b3 3\n\nFL = \u22124 \u03c0r\u03b3 \u2212\n\n\u00b7 2 r 2 ,\n\n(2.7)\n\n2 r\n\n3( E eff)2\n\nwhere r is the radius of curvature of the meniscus.\n\n10\n\nWet adhesion\u2014viscous forces.
