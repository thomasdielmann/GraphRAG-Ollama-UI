Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected.

For example, if you\u2019re trying to make less toxic pigments, \u201cask\u201d\n\nhow nature creates color. If you want to manufacture tough, lightweight building materials without energy-intensive high pressures and temperatures, \u201cask\u201d how nature manages structural forces.\n\nAskNature offers two ways for you to ask questions of nature: using Search and using the Function menu. Using the Search bar on the home page, you can ask questions like those posed above, for example: \u201cHow does nature stay dry?\u201d Further down on the homepage, links to the top level of the Biomimicry Taxonomy enable you to quickly find strategies by function. Clicking on one of the top level functions will lead you to a page where you can access the whole Taxonomy and the AskNature content that addresses each function.\n\nUsing the Biomimicry Taxonomy as a Critial Thinking Tool The Biomimicry Taxonomy is useful not just because it will help you navigate better on AskNature, but because it provides a framework that may help you understand your challenge differently. Here\u2019s an example of how you could use the Taxonomy to help solve your next innovation challenge.\n\nInnovation Challenge: You\u2019re designing a building in an area of low rainfall. To ensure an adequate water supply, you want your building to capture rainwater and store it for future use.\n\nApproach #1: Identify verbs that directly define your challenge. Use the Biomimicry Taxonomy for ideas that help you shift from predetermined thoughts of how or what you\u2019ll design to why you\u2019re designing (in other words, your design\u2019s purpose or the outcomes it must accomplish). Use verbs that describe functions (such as: move, break down, distribute, etc.). In this example, the questions you pose might be: How does nature\u2026\n\n\u2022 Capture water?\n\n\u2022 Store water?\n\nApproach #2: Consider concepts that go beyond your exact challenge but are related enough to why you\u2019re designing that they may have similar solutions. In this example, you may consider that some organisms (like the Namib beetle) live in areas that experience little to no rain, yet they still get all of the water they need. Use the Biomimicry Taxonomy to spark ideas for new verbs, and also think about related nouns or synonyms. In this example, questions to pose might include: How does nature\u2026\n\n\u2022 Absorb water?\n\n\u2022 Capture fog?\n\n\u2022 Manage humidity?\n\n\u2022 Move water?\n\nApproach #\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "sciphi/triplex:latest", "temperature": 0.5, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 1024, "n": null}}
