This frog 7:2\n\nhas just landed on a bamboo stem, and has slipped downwards, leaving behind some of the watery fluid that forms its adhesive 0190131\n\njoint ( b) (Allan L, 2013, personal communication).\n\nthe ventral surface of the toes (toe pads), with related structures (sub-articular tubercles) being located on the ventral surface of more proximal digits. The latter is mainly used in attachment to small diameter structures such as twigs [22]. Features important to the functioning of the toe pads are highlighted below:\n\nGrooves surround each toe pad ( circumferal and proximal grooves). These grooves (shown in\n\nfigure 2 b) will divert water around the pad in the wet environments (e.g. rain forests) in which the majority of tree frog species live. Such structures are particularly important in torrent frogs, which would otherwise be washed downstream by the water that covers the rocks on which they are found [24].\n\nThe toe pads are epithelial structures, consisting of several layers of cells [14, 25,26]. Their development can be clearly seen by the examination of transverse sections of the toes, where the deepest layers are the least specialized and the outermost the fully developed pad cells. At intervals, the outermost layer is shed, the layer beneath becoming the new surface layer (figure 3).\n\nIn this way, the frog can maintain fully functional toe pads throughout its adult life.\n\nDownloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 09 July 2023\n\nToe pads are extremely soft structures, aiding close contact to external surfaces and enhancing both adhesion and friction. Indentation experiments using spherical indenters of 264 and 1500 \u00b5m diameter [27] show a gradient of elastic modulus from 4 to 25 kPa, the higher values being found in the outermost, keratinized, layers. Such low values for the elastic modulus are comparable to sea anemone mesoglea or jellyfish jelly ( E \u2248 3 kPa [28]). The elastic modulus of a surface can also be calculated from force/distance curves produced by an AFM indenter [29]. Using this method, estimates of the elastic modulus of the external surface of the pad (the method does not provide information\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "qwen2:7b", "temperature": 0.5, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 1024, "n": null}}
