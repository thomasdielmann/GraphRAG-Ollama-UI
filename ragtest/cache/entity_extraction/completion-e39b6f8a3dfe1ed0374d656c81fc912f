{"result": " In this text, the main entities are \"Biomimetics,\" \"Sustainability,\" and various research topics related to Biomimicry such as \"Morphological study of animals\" (e.g., geckos, beetles), \"Investigations on materials and surfaces,\" \"Design methodologies and processes interconnected with sustainability factors,\" etc.\n\nThe concept of \"Biomimetics\" is the primary focus, and it seems to have significant connections with various research areas, particularly those related to sustainability, sustainable development, waste management, circular economy, design methodologies, eco-design, bio-inspired design, creative analogies, etc. These connections are evident from the co-occurrence of these terms in different colored groups.\n\nThe event \"Biomimetics 2023\" is also mentioned, and it appears to be a conference related to Biomimetic research. The time period under investigation is from 1991 to 2021, with a more recent focus on the years 2018-2021 for the bibliographic coupling analysis.\n\nThe relationship between these entities can be summarized as follows:\n1. Biomimetics (Entity) - Sustainability (Concept): Biomimetic research is heavily intertwined with sustainability, as seen by the co-occurrence of related terms in different colored groups.\n2. Biomimetics 2023 (Event) - Research Topics: The Biomimetics 2023 event likely focuses on the discussion and presentation of recent research findings in various biomimetic domains, including sustainability-related topics.\n3. Various Research Topics - Sustainability (Concept): Many different biomimetic research areas show a strong emphasis on sustainability, as evidenced by terms related to this concept being distributed across multiple colored groups.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

In orange, words focused on principles and practices of sustainable development, waste management, and circular economy stand out. The brown cluster refers to the morphological study of animals such as geckos and beetles. The group in yellow is directed toward investigations on materials and surfaces (e.g., adhesion properties, locomotion). In the purple group, themes linked to the exploration of design methodologies and processes interconnected with sustainability factors, eco-design, bio-inspired design, and the use of creative analogies can be found.\n\nIt is interesting to note that terms related to sustainability were distributed in more than one colored group. It can be inferred that this topic is one of the notable potentials of biomimicry creations and technologies. As such, it permeates many different subjects related to research and production of biomimetic design including a diversity of application scales (city level, construction, object, materials, and surface properties).\n\nOnce the citation, co-citation, co-occurrence, and word cloud prospecting stages were Biomimetics 2023, 8, 61\n\n10 of 16\n\ncompleted\u2014all referring to the period from 1991 to 2021\u2014another temporal filter was used to carry out the bibliographic coupling analysis (years from 2018 to 2021), obtaining a total of 78 publications.
