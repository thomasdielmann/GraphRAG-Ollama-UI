A common model that has been used for quantifying capillary forces consists of a sphere on a plane surface, connected by a drop of liquid (figure 7). In this model, appropriate as toe pads are slightly domed, the surface tension of the meniscus results in a pressure difference, where the pressure inside the liquid is lower than it is outside, so long as the meniscus is concave. This pressure difference, the Laplace pressure, will resist the separation of the two surfaces. The attractive Laplace force for a macroscopic, perfectly smooth and homogeneous sphere in contact with a plane is given by\n\nFL = \u22122 \u03c0R\u03b3 (cos \u03b8 1 + cos \u03b8 2),\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere R is the radius of the sphere, \u03b3 is the surface tension of the liquid, and \u03b8 1 and \u03b8 2 are the contact angles of the liquid with the plane surface and sphere, respectively. If the liquid completely wets both surfaces (i.e. \u03b8 1 and \u03b8 2 both equal 0), equation (2.1) simplifies to FL = \u22124 \u03c0R\u03b3 .\n\n(2.2)\n\nAn alternative model examines capillary forces between two rigid plates, separated by a thin layer of fluid (figure 8).
