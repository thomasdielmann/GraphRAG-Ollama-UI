In the authors\u2019 opinion, the insertion of biomimetic knowledge and principles into new economic and business approaches can promote innovation in the organizational sphere. In fact, this work contributed to the recognition of biomimicry as an area from which knowledge can be useful in the strategic, administrative, and organizational plans of companies.\n\nXing et al. [43] combined the study of plants, more specifically plant cells, with the development of fa\u00e7ade design and technologies for building cladding, resulting in a con-\n\n\n\n\n\nBiomimetics 2023, 8, 61\n\n11 of 16\n\nceptual proposal for a biodome, with improvements in thermal insulation and energy efficiency. The authors prioritized the study of plant-based analogies to generate constructive proposals, due to the sessile character of plants, which requires them to adapt to the surrounding conditions (as they fixed in a single location, a characteristic also associated with buildings). Xing et al. generated a framework for the design process of biomimetic projects.\n\nAmer [44] incorporated biomimetic notions into the syllabus of a university course, covering the following topics: interrelationships between biomimicry and building design; project methodology; natural lighting management; and plant-inspired fa\u00e7ades; as well as research activities, design, parametric digital prototyping (with Rhinoceros and Grasshopper software), and the use of the biomimetic design concept generation matrix.\n\nAccording to the author, the students realized the importance of the responsibility inherent in professional practice regarding the preservation of the health of human communities and those of other species.\n\nAdditionally, in Figure 4, two more nuclei can be observed, with the works of Clark [45]\n\nand Zari [46]. The first publication researched marine biomineralization for monitoring and forecasting the impacts of climate change and for the design of new biocomposite materials [45]. In the second publication, Zari [46] endeavored to analyze how the urban environment can insert new proposals into its design that incorporate ecosystem services committed to the regeneration of biodiversity and the resilience of natural environments faced with climate change.\n\nIn summary, an examination of the results from the coupling analysis allowed verifica-tion that the themes of recent research in biomimicry and design include, on one hand, the investigation\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "qwen2:7b", "temperature": 0.5, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 1024, "n": null}}
