The muscle activity that bends the body and produces these movements during steady, continuous swimming can cost a significant amount of energy. But some fishes, such as rainbow trout, can adopt a special swimming behavior that likely enables them to save their own energy by extracting energy from nearby water vortices.\n\nIn a fluid environment, vortices are swirls of water or air often released (or \u201cshed\u201d) from stationary objects and other living creatures, including other fish, that are in the path of an oncoming flow.\n\nTrout use water vortices that come their way from upstream sources to their advantage by adjusting their typical swimming behavior to produce a\n\n\u2018slalom\u2019 movement between vortices.

If it\u2019s dry, pine cones on the ground will let down their slender scales and open up like the fingers of an unfurling fist. If rain and humidity are in the air, the scales will clamp up like a castle drawbridge, overlapping one another and sealing the cone into a tight ball.\n\nThe idea is simple\u2014to open and release seeds when conditions are best for winds to carry them far and wide. Wet weather dampens dispersal. But how do they\n\n\u201csense\u201d humidity when pine cones contain no living cells?\n\nAnd how do they move without any muscles or nerves?\n\nThe Strategy\n\nThe secret lies in the structure of their scales.

Clicking on one of the top level functions will lead you to a page where you can access the whole Taxonomy and the AskNature content that addresses each function.\n\nUsing the Biomimicry Taxonomy as a Critial Thinking Tool The Biomimicry Taxonomy is useful not just because it will help you navigate better on AskNature, but because it provides a framework that may help you understand your challenge differently. Here\u2019s an example of how you could use the Taxonomy to help solve your next innovation challenge.\n\nInnovation Challenge: You\u2019re designing a building in an area of low rainfall. To ensure an adequate water supply, you want your building to capture rainwater and store it for future use.\n\nApproach #1: Identify verbs that directly define your challenge. Use the Biomimicry Taxonomy for ideas that help you shift from predetermined thoughts of how or what you\u2019ll design to why you\u2019re designing (in other words, your design\u2019s purpose or the outcomes it must accomplish). Use verbs that describe functions (such as: move, break down, distribute, etc.). In this example, the questions you pose might be: How does nature\u2026\n\n\u2022 Capture water?\n\n\u2022 Store water?\n\nApproach #2: Consider concepts that go beyond your exact challenge but are related enough to why you\u2019re designing that they may have similar solutions. In this example, you may consider that some organisms (like the Namib beetle) live in areas that experience little to no rain, yet they still get all of the water they need. Use the Biomimicry Taxonomy to spark ideas for new verbs, and also think about related nouns or synonyms. In this example, questions to pose might include: How does nature\u2026\n\n\u2022 Absorb water?\n\n\u2022 Capture fog?\n\n\u2022 Manage humidity?\n\n\u2022 Move water?\n\nApproach #","chunk_id":"e4b6193a4ea13cb8c682998eb02efb6d","document_ids":["a102cdf19bc35f57dee1ff8698a21683"],"n_tokens":512,"entities":[{"name":"\"ASKNATURE\"","type":"\"ORGANIZATION\"","description":"\"AskNature is an online platform providing access to strategies and insights from natural systems for design solutions.\" ) (\"entity\"","source_id":"e4b6193a4ea13cb8c682998eb02efb6d"}],"entity_graph":"<graphml xmlns=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\/1.0\/graphml.xsd\">  <key id=\"d2\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"source_id\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d1\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"description\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d0\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"type\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <graph edgedefault=\"undirected\">    <node id=\"&quot;ASKNATURE&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"ORGANIZATION\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"AskNature is an online platform providing access to strategies and insights from natural systems for design solutions.\" ) (\"entity\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">e4b6193a4ea13cb8c682998eb02efb6d<\/data>    <\/node>  <\/graph><\/graphml>"}

Instead of asking how nature stores water, think about how it protects against excess water or keeps water out. Although counterintuitive, sometimes asking the opposite of your original question can provide new insights to your real challenge. The Biomimicry Taxonomy is a great resource for ideas of verbs that represent opposites. In this example, you might ask: How does nature\u2026\n\n\u2022 Remove water?\n\n\u2022 Stay dry?\n\n2\n\nBiomimicry.org | AskNature.org\n\nind\n\near\n\nes\n\nases\n\nases\n\ns\n\nirt\/solids\n\ns\n\neostasis\n\nical w\n\nlid\n\nh g\n\nuid\n\nicrob\n\nuclear radiation\n\nelting \u2022 Fracture\/rupture\n\nrarily\n\nanently\n\no\n\nicals \u2022 Fire \u2022 Ice\n\nhem\n\np\n\nn so\n\nals \u2022 Plants\n\nal shock\n\nerm\n\nhem\n\naintain hom\n\nnim\n\nFUNCTION\n\near \u2022 C\n\n\u2022 P \u2022 Tem\n\npression\n\n\u2022 In\/o \u2022 In\/on liq \u2022 In\/throug\n\nperature \u2022 N\n\n\u2022 A \u2022 Fungi \u2022 M \u2022 Excess liquids \u2022 W\n\n\u2022 Loss of liquids \u2022 G\n\nation \u2022 Fatigue \u2022 M\n\n\u2022 Loss of gases \u2022 D\n\n\u2022 Light \u2022 C\n\npact \u2022 Tension \u2022 Turbulence\n\nTS\n\n\u2022 Tem\n\nA\n\nechanical w\n\nE\n\n\u2022 Shear \u2022 Therm\n\nR\n\n\n\n\u2022 Im \u2022 M\n\nG\n\n\u2022 Creep \u2022 Com\n\nTH\n\nIN\n\nGIN\n\n\u2022 Reproduction or growth\n\n\u2022 Cel ular processes \u2022 M\n\n-LIV\n\nN\n\nRCES\n\nLIV\n\nO\n\nM\n\nN\n\nL FO\n\nO\n\nM\n\nRA\n\nCESSES\n\nithin the same species \u2022 Cooperate\/compete between dif erent species\n\n\u2022 Coordinate by self-organization \u2022 Activities \u2022 Systems\n\n\u2022 Buckling \u2022 Deform\n\nH\n\nT FR\n\nithin a (eco)system \u2022 Cooperate\/compete between (eco)systems CTU\n\n\u2022 W\n\nC\n\nC\n\nE\n\nT FRO\n\nL.

Thus, a systematic review was undertaken to identify, describe, and analyze the contributions of biomimicry to design. For this purpose, the integrative systematic review model, called the Theory of Consolidated Meta-Analytical Approach, was used, carrying out a search on the Web of Science with the descriptors \u201cdesign\u201d and \u201cbiomimicry\u201d. For the period from 1991 to 2021, 196 publications were retrieved. The results were organized according to areas of knowledge, countries, journals, institutions, authors, and years. Citation, co-citation, and bibliographic coupling analyses were also performed. The investigation highlighted the following research emphases: the conception of products, buildings, and environments; the exploration of natural structures and systems to create materials and technologies; the use of biomimetic creative tools in product design; and projects focused on saving resources and implementing sustainability. It was noted that there was a tendency for authors to adopt a problem-based approach. It was concluded that the study of biomimicry can stimulate the development of multiple skills in design, improving creativity, and enhancing the potential integration of sustainability into production cycles.\n\nKeywords: design; biomimicry; biomimetic design; systematic review; bio-inspiration; bionics; bio-inspired design; nature-inspired design; bio-informed design; sustainability Citation: S\u00e1, A.A.M.d.; Viana, D.M.\n\nDesign and Biomimicry: A Review of\n\nInterconnections and Creative\n\n1.

In this way, by observing organisms, biological processes, and ecosystems, solutions can be developed to meet the needs and challenges of the various spheres of human activity, such as in the design of products, environments, services, and digital technologies [6\u20138].\n\nGiven the scope of the present work, it is necessary to remark on the persistent im-passes regarding the use of terminologies by scholars and professionals involved in creative activities inspired by nature. Some authors adopt the bio-derived terms interchange-ably [9]. That is, in a given publication, they globally adopt some bio-derived expressions, which does not allow to sufficiently distinguish the understanding they possessed from the conceptual point of view when structuring and carrying out their studies. Other researchers rely on the specific conceptualization of terms, in line with the ISO 18458:2015\n\nStandard [10,11]. However, for some biomimicry researchers\u2014such as Iouguina et al. [12]\n\nand Speck et al. [13]\u2014this field of inspiration in nature has been expanding rapidly, and it is increasingly necessary to differentiate even more clearly and objectively several basic notions, such as biomimicry, biomimetics, bionics, and bioinspiration. For authors who share this concern, even though there are already different understandings of these terms, they are still insufficient. This happens because many authors use different nomenclatures, but, depending on the specific contexts in which each researcher or professional is inserted, these words may reflect cultural factors and aspects of their specializations, which need to be clarified to enhance future work and research. In other words, more theoretical and empirical studies are needed to better delimit the concepts underlying biomimicry. In this sense, review works are very important, despite the advances already achieved. In summary, a close examination of the area reveals that certain biomimetic concepts can be understood as equivalent by certain authors, while, for others, they are perceived as different or complementary [12\u201314]. In view of the above, it is essential to explain that, in the present work, the word \u201cbiomimicry\u201d was adopted due to","chunk_id":"2aee03ca69624bff0ae2d030f6f31e19","document_ids":["a7ae1f321221e8d106ca68c1dbf9dcc8"],"n_tokens":512,"entities":[{"name":"\"BIOMIMETICS 2023\"","type":"\"PUBLICATION\"","description":"\"The publication titled 'Biomimetics' with volume number of 8 and issue number 61 from the year 2023.\")","source_id":"2aee03ca69624bff0ae2d030f6f31e19"}],"entity_graph":"<graphml xmlns=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\/1.0\/graphml.xsd\">  <key id=\"d2\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"source_id\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d1\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"description\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d0\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"type\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <graph edgedefault=\"undirected\">    <node id=\"&quot;BIOMIMETICS 2023&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"PUBLICATION\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"The publication titled 'Biomimetics' with volume number of 8 and issue number 61 from the year 2023.\")<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">2aee03ca69624bff0ae2d030f6f31e19<\/data>    <\/node>  <\/graph><\/graphml>"}

In view of the above, it is essential to explain that, in the present work, the word \u201cbiomimicry\u201d was adopted due to the advantages that still exist when opting for a comprehensive term with wide dissemination. Furthermore, as evidenced by Iouguina et al. [12] and Gamage and Hyde [15], this nomenclature refers to a theoretical and technical framework that can be considered more accessible, in addition to being closely associated with the disciplines of design, architecture, and philosophy.\n\nAdditionally, to support the bibliographical research that was undertaken, which will be presented and discussed later, it is worth remembering that a survey of the specialized literature constitutes an essential approach for the systematization of knowledge already gathered, in addition to allowing the identification of trends and to suggesting an agenda for future research, especially in the case of emerging areas of knowledge. Indeed, many review techniques are available (e.g., narrative, integrative, systematic, meta-analyses) [16\u201318].\n\nAmong these possibilities is the integrative systematic review model called the Theory of Consolidated Meta-Analytical Approach (TEMAC). This resource, based on bibliometric laws, helps in the development of: research preparation; presentation and interrelation of data; integrative model and validation by evidences. TEMAC is a multilingual model that enables research in various databases, such as the Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar, for reviewing international literature in different areas of knowledge. Furthermore, this resource recommends the adoption of free software such as VOSViewer and TagCrowd for processing and visualization of data. Through TEMAC, it is possible to obtain an overview of the works and productions of an area, to elaborate integrative models, and to carry out comparisons between publications, institutions, and countries [19].\n\nIn summary, as the study and application of biological knowledge enables the realization of creative projects in several areas, it is necessary to better understand the use of these resources specifically in design. Thus, in this work, emphasis was given to biomimetic design, also understood as biomimicry-based design, that could be defined as the creative implementation of biologically-inspired concepts, ideas, and strategies into functional products to solve human challenges, that may have the potential to meet the current needs of sustainability in design.

Materials and Methods\n\nThe investigation was carried out in the Web of Science database, using the descriptors biomimicry and design. The period between 1991 and 2021 was configured as the time range for the searches, totaling three decades. It should be noted that the first decade of this interval coincides with the publication of the work by Benyus, Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature, which contributed to the dissemination of the term \u201cbiomimicry\u201d [22].\n\nTo carry out the systematic review, the Theory of Consolidated Meta-Analytical Approach (TEMAC) integrative model was adopted. This resource recommends organizing the information collected in the database according to areas of knowledge, countries, journals, institutions, authors, and years. In addition, TEMAC guides the performance of citation, co-citation, coupling, co-occurrence, and word cloud analyses with the generation of images, such as heat maps and network or line maps. For this purpose, the VOSViewer and TagCrowd platforms were used [23].\n\nIt is worth clarifying that citation analysis is one of the means of measuring the impact of authors\u2019 production based on the number of citations listed in the database. Evidently, it is important not to mistake the popularity of an author or publication with the relevance of the scientific work developed, but it is an interesting comparative parameter. The co-citation analysis corresponds to works that are frequently cited together by other publications.\n\nThe greater the number of co-citations of a document, the greater its prominence in the literature, and the more likely its semantic relationship with the other two documents will be.

The co-citation analysis corresponds to works that are frequently cited together by other publications.\n\nThe greater the number of co-citations of a document, the greater its prominence in the literature, and the more likely its semantic relationship with the other two documents will be. Coupling establishes that when two documents cite the same third publication in their bibliographies, this is an indicator that these works have similarities [19, 23].\n\nIn TEMAC, it is common to delimit longer periods for co-citation than for coupling, since the first type of analysis is adopted to highlight the most-used thematic approaches in the study of a given topic (comprehensive panorama), while the second type, focuses on reduced intervals and, therefore, tends to show the main fronts of contemporary research [19, 23,24]. Therefore, in the present work, co-citation covered the period from 1991 to 2021, and coupling comprised the years from 2018 to 2021. Bearing in mind these methodological guidelines, interrelationships were established between the data obtained with the help of TEMAC and the content of the identified works.\n\n3. Results\n\nPreliminarily, 633 documents were obtained. It is considered essential to point out that, as biomimicry is a recent area\u2014especially when associated with the field of design\u2014various types of documents were examined in the present literature review, including articles, publications in proceedings of events, and books. The research of such works is pertinent because they represent important sources of information and can contain and record discoveries in emerging areas.\n\nThe oldest work found on the Web of Science was the article by Li et al. (1995), in which the authors explored structural applications of synthetic composites and natural bamboo fibers [25]. The material produced showed mechanical behavior similar to resistant structures present in nature. Considering this pioneering study with a biomimetic approach, it is pertinent to highlight that the initial works on the subject were directed mainly at the study of materials from an engineering perspective (especially at microscopic and nanoscopic scales), including physicochemical and structural investigations. With regard to pioneering efforts and research, it should be noted that studies and applications, more clearly related to the areas of design and architecture, followed in greater numbers after the publication of the book by Janine Benyus (1997), that is, from the end of the 1990s [22].\n\nBiomimetics 2023, 8, 61\n\n4 of","chunk_id":"fe902bcadf86addbe747f348c1ccc56f","document_ids":["a7ae1f321221e8d106ca68c1dbf9dcc8"],"n_tokens":512,"entities":[{"name":"\"ORGANIZATION\"","type":"\"WEB OF SCIENCE\"","description":"\"A database used in bibliometric analysis that helps researchers and academics find relevant publications and analyze academic trends.\"","source_id":"fe902bcadf86addbe747f348c1ccc56f"}],"entity_graph":"<graphml xmlns=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\/1.0\/graphml.xsd\">  <key id=\"d2\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"source_id\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d1\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"description\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d0\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"type\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <graph edgedefault=\"undirected\">    <node id=\"&quot;ORGANIZATION&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"WEB OF SCIENCE\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"A database used in bibliometric analysis that helps researchers and academics find relevant publications and analyze academic trends.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">fe902bcadf86addbe747f348c1ccc56f<\/data>    <\/node>  <\/graph><\/graphml>"}

Thus, divergent categories were excluded (e.g., agriculture, medicine, dentistry, physics, chemistry, biochemistry, materials science, electrical engineering, computer science, mathematics, nanoscience, nanotechnology, pharmacy, and neurosciences).

[9]. In the aforementioned article, the authors emphasized that biomimicry requires specific tools and processes. One possibility highlighted by Vincent et al. is the use of the TRIZ heuristic matrix, which can be adapted for biologically-inspired projects in the BioTRIZ tool. In it, notions obtained from natural systems are used, transferring configurations to conceive innovations in the creation of technological systems and projects, mainly with the inclusion of energetic and structural aspects based on nature.\n\nThe publication by Helms, Vattam, and Goel [35] about the naturally inspired approaches that integrate analogy systems to develop solutions in product design lies in this same cluster. This study featured the two main approaches adopted in biomimetic projects: one centered on the design problem (known as design for biology or problem-based approach) and another, which starts directly from the study of a natural aspect (known as biology to design or solution-driven approach).

Supported by various examples and cases, the author emphasized the importance of considering: structural efficiency; mindful use of resources; understanding manufacturing processes; analysis and implementation of zero-waste systems; clean energy generation; and water saving.\n\nIn the lower central portion of the co-citation map are Chakrabarti et al. [37], whose article presented the GEMS of SAPPhIRE Model of Causality tool, which contributes to the functional comprehension and definition in biomimetic design projects. This model enabled the development of a computational tool and a database that help designers find solutions for their projects based on analogies of natural and artificial systems (IDEA-INSPIRE). The authors concluded that natural systems have been insufficiently adopted as a source of inspiration for design projects, unlike artificial systems. Thus, their proposal is very relevant to the field of biomimetic product design and the systematization of idea generation.\n\nOther publications, shown in Figure 1, are also worth mentioning. Located in the lower left part of the co-citation map, is the Biomimicry Resource Handbook manual by Baumeister et al. [38], which provides the essentials of biomimicry, including guidelines for applying biomimetic methods, approaches, and tools to conduct creative projects (e.g., Biomimicry Thinking Design Lens, Challenge to Biology and Biology to Design approaches, Biomimicry Taxonomy Chart, Life\u2019s Principles Diagram).\n\nAnother interesting work found on the map is Cradle to Cradle by Braungart and McDonough [39], which is positioned in the upper left portion of the map. This publication proposes reinventing the life cycle of products and processes. In their work, the authors emphasized the integration of design and science to favor lasting social benefits, stimulating the regeneration of the natural realm and the improvement of human quality of life.\n\nThey also advocated the use of safe materials, water, and energy in the context of the circular economy, eliminating the concepts of waste and disposal.

In the authors\u2019 opinion, the insertion of biomimetic knowledge and principles into new economic and business approaches can promote innovation in the organizational sphere. In fact, this work contributed to the recognition of biomimicry as an area from which knowledge can be useful in the strategic, administrative, and organizational plans of companies.\n\nXing et al.

The authors prioritized the study of plant-based analogies to generate constructive proposals, due to the sessile character of plants, which requires them to adapt to the surrounding conditions (as they fixed in a single location, a characteristic also associated with buildings). Xing et al. generated a framework for the design process of biomimetic projects.\n\nAmer [44] incorporated biomimetic notions into the syllabus of a university course, covering the following topics: interrelationships between biomimicry and building design; project methodology; natural lighting management; and plant-inspired fa\u00e7ades; as well as research activities, design, parametric digital prototyping (with Rhinoceros and Grasshopper software), and the use of the biomimetic design concept generation matrix.\n\nAccording to the author, the students realized the importance of the responsibility inherent in professional practice regarding the preservation of the health of human communities and those of other species.\n\nAdditionally, in Figure 4, two more nuclei can be observed, with the works of Clark [45]\n\nand Zari [46].

On the other hand, there is a focus on the design of components, coatings, and finishes for application in architecture, including bioclimatic factors (e.g., local context, energy, and resource savings) and environmental responsiveness. This enables envisaging the creation of adaptable buildings that operate similarly to living organisms. In this scope, the authors mainly investigated plant elements as a source of inspiration. Among the highlighted works, there were also many proposals for creative tools, frameworks, and parametric software that aim to assist in the search for biological solutions and the transfer of such natural characteristics to the conceptual development in design. Another research emphasis focused on sustainability, including aspects of ecosystems and interspecific ecological relationships that demonstrate the potential to inspire a multiplicity of projects, such as the design of products and even strategic design. In addition, in the present study, there were research perspectives that addressed, respectively, the importance of supporting ecosystem services in the urban environment and the development of materials such as biocomposites.\n\nGiven what is presented above, it is possible to infer that the coupling analysis highlighted initiatives in biomimetic design that demonstrate a remarkable capacity to generate innovations to solve emerging challenges in several fields of human activity. Finally, it should be stressed that, once again, the authors highlighted in the densest cluster produced research and projects guided by the problem-based approach.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThe results of this systematic review allowed establishing connections and making conjectures about the scenarios of publications indexed by the Web of Science. It is be-lieved that the panorama of productions showcased in the present research encompasses contributions that may assist researchers and designers in their endeavors, as the main themes and emphases of projects and research were identified in the investigated literature, representing possible paths for new creations and studies.\n\nThe analysis of the data obtained through this survey indicated that the works involving design and biomimicry are associated with the following thematic aspects: (a) the conception of products, buildings, and environments; (b) the exploration of structural and\n\nBiomimetics 2023, 8, 61\n\n12 of 16\n\nsystemic conform","chunk_id":"f5fd896ed0c59d47158db316fad680dc","document_ids":["a7ae1f321221e8d106ca68c1dbf9dcc8"],"n_tokens":512,"entities":[{"name":"\"NEW PROPOSALS\"","type":"\"EVENT\"","description":"\"The introduction of innovative concepts that integrate ecosystem services to support biodiversity and natural environment resilience against climate change.\")|(\"entity\"","source_id":"f5fd896ed0c59d47158db316fad680dc"}],"entity_graph":"<graphml xmlns=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\/1.0\/graphml.xsd\">  <key id=\"d2\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"source_id\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d1\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"description\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d0\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"type\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <graph edgedefault=\"undirected\">    <node id=\"&quot;NEW PROPOSALS&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"EVENT\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"The introduction of innovative concepts that integrate ecosystem services to support biodiversity and natural environment resilience against climate change.\")|(\"entity\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">f5fd896ed0c59d47158db316fad680dc<\/data>    <\/node>  <\/graph><\/graphml>"}

In this sense, it is pertinent to mention that the publications, which were listed and organized in this review, reflect development in several areas of cutting-edge technology, which is consistent with the innovative tendency intrinsic to the field of biomimicry.\n\nHowever, it is relevant to underscore that there is still a scarcity of works oriented toward the development and use of everyday objects and in the field of services, given that these are two areas of great importance in the design domain. In view of this finding, it is reasonable to assume that more efforts and investments are required in design projects that clearly and consistently recognize their foundation in the principles of biomimicry.\n\nThus, it is crucial to more frequently adopt a biomimicry perspective to research and develop products intended for the daily lives of consumers, in order to guarantee a better quality of life for the users of these objects (e.g., bio-inspired functional and technological improvements of products). This limitation is even more alarming upon verifying that most of the publications retrieved from the Web of Science originate from engineering and architecture schools and departments. As a result, there are not enough projects produced by teams from schools and departments associated exclusively with the field of design. It is possible to assume that the absence of the \u2018design\u2019 filter when searching the Web of Science may constitute a restriction for specific dissemination of works.\n\nAnother trend observed in the present review, highlighted by the analysis of the heat maps, concerns which type of biomimicry-based approach the authors adopted in their projects and research.

The results indicated that many of them started by addressing the problem and the required function (problem-based approach) instead of beginning directly from the investigation of natural aspects (solution-driven approach). It should be clarified that this could be expected since the survey encompassed the field of design, an area where projects and creative processes commonly begin with the definition of a problem or a challenge associated with human activity. However, supporting the development of more projects and research in design based on the solution-driven approach can also be of great interest, as it can contribute to enhancing and refining creative skills. In addition, this approach contributes to establishing connections with specialists from other areas (e.g., biologists) and may also help bring designers closer to field research in nature.\n\nRegarding design processes, efforts were made to provide information about biomimetic tools that assist in the planning and execution of creative proposals (e.g., Biomimicry Thinking Design Lens, Biomimicry Taxonomy Chart, BioTRIZ, GEMS of SAPPhIRE, IDEA-INSPIRE, BECE-Framework) [9,15, 30,35,37,38]. Such instruments, connected to the problem-based approach, mainly focus on the conceptual development phase of the project, supporting the investigation of characteristics of nature in their transposition into the design domain. In addition, various digital resources were explored by the authors to generate complex shapes and patterns for models and products (e.g., parametric software and rapid prototyping). The use of biomimetic tools in creative design processes, reported in the analyzed literature, can still be considered restricted, given that there was not enough detail on the application of such instruments. Consequently, it was not possible to verify, in this review, whether the authors resorted to other resources or documents, or if they deliberately chose not to include this information in the communication of their works.\n\nThe TEMAC model contributed to the identification of the main themes, approaches, and trends in the literature. Through it, it was possible to infer which areas are expanding and which deserve to be further investigated. The tool also allowed comparisons to be made between the works and production of different authors, countries, and institutions.\n\nBiomimetics 2023, 8,","chunk_id":"916f17bde39ae650dad1b657a1887fa6","document_ids":["a7ae1f321221e8d106ca68c1dbf9dcc8"],"n_tokens":512,"entities":[{"name":"\"WEB OF SCIENCE\"","type":"\"ORGANIZATION\"","description":"\"The Web of Science is a comprehensive database used for academic research that may limit the accessibility or dissemination of certain works based on specific criteria.\"","source_id":"916f17bde39ae650dad1b657a1887fa6"}],"entity_graph":"<graphml xmlns=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\/1.0\/graphml.xsd\">  <key id=\"d2\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"source_id\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d1\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"description\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d0\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"type\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <graph edgedefault=\"undirected\">    <node id=\"&quot;WEB OF SCIENCE&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"ORGANIZATION\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"The Web of Science is a comprehensive database used for academic research that may limit the accessibility or dissemination of certain works based on specific criteria.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">916f17bde39ae650dad1b657a1887fa6<\/data>    <\/node>  <\/graph><\/graphml>"}

However, like any procedure for surveying and analyzing the literature, it is crucial to understand that, from the moment specifications are established for the research themes, descriptors, software, databases, and filters that will be used, it is inevitable that certain works will not be captured by the selected criteria, which can limit the scope of the contributions of a review such as the present work.\n\nThe chosen database for this research (Web of Science) is one of the main multidisci-plinary repositories, having an excellent temporal coverage of publications, in addition to ensuring a frequent update of indexed works, including complementary materials such as conference proceedings [19]. Nevertheless, the Web of Science mainly covers content published in English and, as discussed earlier, there is no specific filtering function for the field of design. Thus, the investigation of other multilingual repositories, such as Scopus, Google Scholar, EBSCO, ProQuest [19, 47] is recommended. Furthermore, when analyzing other systematic reviews, it is noticeable that other software and platforms, in addition to those employed in the present review, have been used by authors to organize and facilitate data processing. Some examples are: MAXQDA, CiteSpace, Publish or Perish, San-keyMATIc, Bibexcel, Gephi, Pajek, Ucinet, and Science of Science (Sci2) [47\u201349].\n\nThe adoption of the descriptors biomimicry and design was sufficient to achieve the objectives proposed in the scope of this research. However, considering that only two descriptors were used, it is suggested that more terms be incorporated in future surveys, such as: bioinspiration, biomimetics, bionics, biodesign, biomimetic design, bioinspired design, bionic design, nature-based design, nature-inspired design, biologically-inspired design, and bio-informed design.

Thus, it will be possible to cover an even greater number of works, which may lead to relevant developments for the scientific and professional communities.\n\nIn summary, with this review, it is necessary to emphasize the importance of adopting interdisciplinary knowledge in the field of design to expand the creative perspectives of professionals and to diversify theories, approaches, and resources. In this sense, biomimicry has shown itself to be an area of great potential for projects in design. In this work, the expression \u201cbiomimetic design\u201d was generically adopted when analyzing publications from the intersection between the design and biomimicry domains. However, it is necessary to understand that further efforts are needed in favor of more \u2018genuinely\u2019 biomimetic designs, developed in the specific field of design, in which, throughout the entire creative process of products and services, the concepts, principles, and creative tools of biomimicry are effectively integrated.\n\nUnlike technologies that require specific procedures, authorizations, investments, and monetization for access, nature is an extensive (and more accessible) repository of resources that can be investigated and interpreted by human beings, which can complement and expand current practices in design. Furthermore, as evidenced by several authors, the field of design is plural and interdisciplinary, as it seeks to enable creations for different areas of human endeavor [1\u20134, 50\u201355]. Including the perspective of biomimicry in teaching and professional practice scenarios in design can expand creative horizons, allowing the creation of innovative solutions that are more efficient, economical, and better adapted to consumer needs and environmental diversity [6, 55,56].\n\nFinally, as the study of aspects of biomimicry in design can enhance the development of multiple skills (such as creative and conceptual generation, observation and research, study of materials, graphic expression, and three-dimensional conception and digital modeling), it is important to recognize that understanding nature and knowing how to explore its resources are indispensable requirements for contemporary professional training, since they can encourage creativity as well as the integration of ecological and sustainable factors in production cycles.\n\nBiomimetics 2023, 8, 61\n\n14 of 16\n\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.A.M.d.S.; methodology,","chunk_id":"f8d611d2f89f42ca1550ee673a05d4dd","document_ids":["a7ae1f321221e8d106ca68c1dbf9dcc8"],"n_tokens":512,"entities":[{"name":"\"A.A.M.D.S.\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"A.A.M.d.S. is an author who contributed to a study on the application and importance of biomimicry in design.\") (\"entity\"","source_id":"f8d611d2f89f42ca1550ee673a05d4dd"}],"entity_graph":"<graphml xmlns=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\/1.0\/graphml.xsd\">  <key id=\"d2\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"source_id\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d1\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"description\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d0\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"type\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <graph edgedefault=\"undirected\">    <node id=\"&quot;A.A.M.D.S.&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"PERSON\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"A.A.M.d.S. is an author who contributed to a study on the application and importance of biomimicry in design.\") (\"entity\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">f8d611d2f89f42ca1550ee673a05d4dd<\/data>    <\/node>  <\/graph><\/graphml>"}

Additionally, they self-clean, so that they are resistant to failure through the accumulation of dirt particles [7\u20139]. Initially, work was mainly carried out P\n\non geckos [5,10,11], because they are among the heaviest animals using reversible adhesion for hil.T\n\ntheir locomotion and have an amazing ability to run across ceilings.

As will be described in this review, tree frogs mainly adhere by wet adhesion, as there is a thin layer of fluid between the toe pad and the adhering substrate. The adhesive forces are thought to be capillarity and viscosity-dependent hydrodynamic forces [13\u201315], but a role for van der Waals forces cannot be excluded [16]. Tree frog toe pads also generate friction forces; indeed, maximum friction forces may exceed those arising from adhesion [17,18]. As we shall describe, the tree frog\u2019s adhesive mechanism provides good adhesion and friction on soft wet surfaces, and, as a result, is likely to have many important applications, particularly in the field of medicine.\n\nA significant body of work has also been carried out on insects.

Insects may have hairy pads like geckos (e.g. beetles and flies) or smooth pads like tree frogs (e.g. cockroaches and grasshoppers) [19]. As there is fluid between pad and external surface, it has, until recently, been assumed that insects, like tree frogs, adhere by wet adhesion. However, Labonte & Federle [20]\n\nhave recently questioned this conclusion as their most recent data could be better explained by adhesion using van der Waals forces.\n\nIn this short review, we will discuss the complexities of the structure of tree frog toe pads in relation to their function as well as the development of artificial toe pad analogues.

Additionally, we will describe some recent applications of the tree frog\u2019s mechanisms of adhesion and friction and discuss the current challenges and future perspectives of this exciting field of research.\n\n2. Tree\/torrent frog adhesion\n\n(a) Toe-pad structure and function\n\nAdhesive toe pads are thought to have evolved separately by convergent evolution in several different families of frogs [21]. Most of these families are arboreal, living in trees or shrubs (tree frogs such as Hypsiboas boans (figure 1)). However, adhesive pads are also found in frogs living in the region of waterfalls (torrent frogs of the family Ranidae).

The latter is mainly used in attachment to small diameter structures such as twigs [22]. Features important to the functioning of the toe pads are highlighted below:\n\nGrooves surround each toe pad ( circumferal and proximal grooves). These grooves (shown in\n\nfigure 2 b) will divert water around the pad in the wet environments (e.g. rain forests) in which the majority of tree frog species live. Such structures are particularly important in torrent frogs, which would otherwise be washed downstream by the water that covers the rocks on which they are found [24].\n\nThe toe pads are epithelial structures, consisting of several layers of cells [14, 25,26]. Their development can be clearly seen by the examination of transverse sections of the toes, where the deepest layers are the least specialized and the outermost the fully developed pad cells. At intervals, the outermost layer is shed, the layer beneath becoming the new surface layer (figure 3).\n\nIn this way, the frog can maintain fully functional toe pads throughout its adult life.\n\nDownloaded from https:\/\/royalsocietypublishing.org\/ on 09 July 2023\n\nToe pads are extremely soft structures, aiding close contact to external surfaces and enhancing both adhesion and friction. Indentation experiments using spherical indenters of 264 and 1500 \u00b5m diameter [27] show a gradient of elastic modulus from 4 to 25 kPa, the higher values being found in the outermost, keratinized, layers. Such low values for the elastic modulus are comparable to sea anemone mesoglea or jellyfish jelly ( E \u2248 3 kPa [28]). The elastic modulus of a surface can also be calculated from force\/distance curves produced by an AFM indenter [29].

The elastic modulus of a surface can also be calculated from force\/distance curves produced by an AFM indenter [29]. Using this method, estimates of the elastic modulus of the external surface of the pad (the method does not provide information on deeper structures), are significantly higher, giving a median value of 5.7 MPa. Surface structures will thus have an increased resistance to wear. By contrast, the innermost layers, lying close to sub-dermal lymph spaces and a capillary network, have much lower elastic moduli and thus are extremely soft and pliable. Keratin filaments run inwards from the surface (figure 3) into the pad allowing the pad to maintain its shape in spite of the softness of the pad material [18,24,30,31].\n\n\n\n\n\npolygonal\n\n4\n\ntoe pad\n\nepithelial cells\n\nr\n\n............................................................... o\n\n( a)\n\n( b)\n\n( c)\n\nyalsociet\n\nypublishing\n\n.or\n\n100 mm\n\n5 mm\n\ng\/journal\/rsta\n\n( d )\n\n( e)\n\nPhil.Tran\n\n1 mm\n\n500 nm\n\ns.R.S\n\ntightly packed nanopillars (SEM and TEM)\n\noc.A37\n\nFigure 2.

As described below, they are mainly hexagonal in shape and are surrounded by deep, fluid-filled channels (figure 2 c). These channels are thought to serve two functions. First, they help spread the fluid over the entire pad surface, so that there are no air pockets that would reduce adhesion. Second, under wet conditions, they would help to get rid of excess fluid which would reduce adhesion by increasing the separation of pad and surface. The epithelial surface is not flat, but consists of a dense array of nanopillars, 300\u2013500 nm in diameter and 200\u2013300 nm in height (figure 2 d, e) [29].

Using a laser tweezer technique, Federle et al. [23] have shown that the fluid secreted by the toe pads has a low viscosity in the range 1.25\u20131.51 mPa s\u22121 (figure 5). It is usually referred to as mucus, but detailed chemistry remains to be identified. It is secreted by glands within the toes and passes to the pad surface through narrow ducts which open into the grooves that separate the pad epithelial cells. It completely fills the space below the pad and forms a meniscus around the edge of the pad, producing capillary forces [14, 32]. The fluid is, however, known to contain molecules that act as surfactants Downloaded from https:\/\/royalsocietypublishing.org\/ on 09 July 2023\n\n[33], lowering surface tension and thus allowing capillary adhesion to hydrophobic as well as hydrophilic surfaces (e.g. surfaces of waxy leaves).\n\nThe fluid layer below each epithelial cell has a thickness of the order of a few nanometres. Federle et al.\n\n[23], using interference reflection microscopy, have shown that the fluid under the toe pads has a low thickness, except around the edges of the epithelial cells, where the channels between the epithelial cells are located (figure 6). This means that, in addition to capillary forces, substantial velocity-dependent hydrodynamic forces will be present [34]. Indeed, torrent frogs can adhere in running water when the pads are completely submerged, a situation where capillary forces would be absent [35,36].\n\nTree frog toe pads produce higher friction than adhesive forces, a surprising finding for a fluid joint.\n\nFederle et al.

In this model, appropriate as toe pads are slightly domed, the surface tension of the meniscus results in a pressure difference, where the pressure inside the liquid is lower than it is outside, so long as the meniscus is concave. This pressure difference, the Laplace pressure, will resist the separation of the two surfaces. The attractive Laplace force for a macroscopic, perfectly smooth and homogeneous sphere in contact with a plane is given by\n\nFL = \u22122 \u03c0R\u03b3 (cos \u03b8 1 + cos \u03b8 2),\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere R is the radius of the sphere, \u03b3 is the surface tension of the liquid, and \u03b8 1 and \u03b8 2 are the contact angles of the liquid with the plane surface and sphere, respectively. If the liquid completely wets both surfaces (i.e. \u03b8 1 and \u03b8 2 both equal 0), equation (2.1) simplifies to FL = \u22124 \u03c0R\u03b3 .\n\n(2.2)\n\nAn alternative model examines capillary forces between two rigid plates, separated by a thin layer of fluid (figure 8).

The mathematical equations relate the capillary attraction between the bodies to their elastic repulsion. Although they do not lend themselves to any easy calculation of the adhesive force, they are of interest in that they predict that FM scaling will gradually change from length scaling to area scaling with increasing r, this change occurring more rapidly for materials with a lower effective elastic modulus ( E eff).\n\nFor instance, in equation (2.7) which deals with the Laplace pressure component of adhesion, the first term is proportional to r and is identical to the force with a hard sphere (equation (2.4)), while the second term is proportional to r 2.

Tree frogs are good climbers, many tropical species being found high in the canopy of rain forests. On effectively flat surfaces (e.g. smooth tree trunks), adhesion is the only means by which tree frogs can climb without falling, but on smaller diameter structures (e.g. small stems\/twigs), they can additionally climb using adduction forces by grasping around these structures with their digits [22]. Indeed, as Hill et al. describe, climbing is rapid on small diameter smooth surfaces because adduction and adhesion act together, and the subarticular tubercles are also brought into play. Unlike geckos, tree frogs cannot run across a ceiling, but they can climb vertical and overhanging surfaces, and a small tree frog can hang on to an inverted glass plate using just its toe pads [32]. At rest, thigh and belly skin aid adhesion.\n\nQuantitative measurements of the adhesive forces that can be generated by tree frogs have been made by a simple procedure first developed by Emerson & Diehl [14].

At rest, thigh and belly skin aid adhesion.\n\nQuantitative measurements of the adhesive forces that can be generated by tree frogs have been made by a simple procedure first developed by Emerson & Diehl [14]. Frogs are weighed and then placed \u2018head-up\u2019 on a smooth surface on a rotation platform that is rotated slowly from 0\u00b0\n\n(horizontal), through 90\u00b0 (vertical) to 180\u00b0 (upside-down). The angles at which the frog falls from the surface (fall angle) are recorded. These fall angles are used to calculate maximum adhesive forces by simple trigonometry [32]. If the total toe pad area is also measured, these values can be converted to the force per unit area that toe pads can generate. Figure 10 a shows the masses of Downloaded from https:\/\/royalsocietypublishing.org\/ on 09 July 2023\n\n14 different frog species (12 of which were hylids). Measured total toe pad areas of these same frogs appear in figure 10 b, while angles of fall from the rotation platform for these 14 frog species (means of 10 measurements for each frog) are plotted in figure 11 c. Since frogs have an area-based adhesive system (the toe pads), it is unsurprising that larger (and hence heavier) species fall from the platform at lower angles. From this information, the force per unit area of these toe pads can be calculated (figure 11 d). The positive slope of the line of best fit, though small, is statistically significant ( r = 0.68; d.f. = 11; p < 0.05), and reflects the fact that larger tree frogs have more efficient toe pads. A similar study, but looking at the effects of growth on adhesion of these same species [43], shows similar effects, toe pads becoming more structurally complex as the frogs grow.

Both friction and adhesion components of the resultant force are shown for a 70\u00b0 pull-off, which followed a short initial slide, designed to ensure good initial contact of pad and force plate. A drop of water was then gently added, covering the pad in such a way that the meniscus around the edge of the pad was abolished. As expected, adhesive forces fell to low levels, but recovered following removal of the water (not shown). What was not expected was that friction forces declined as well. The only possible conclusion, supported by subsequent experiments examining the effects of the procedure on the thickness of the fluid layer under the pad using interference reflection microscopy, was that this simple procedure had increased the pad\u2013ground distance. Such a change would of course also have reduced adhesion from viscosity-dependent hydrodynamic forces, and also molecular interactions (e.g. van der Waals forces","chunk_id":"bea216e0fcc7f946f0033c137012a930","document_ids":["b422f2963081b08277436cb3b7fee48d"],"n_tokens":512,"entities":[{"name":"\"WJP BARNES\"&\"W FEDERLE\"","type":"\"ORGANIZATION\"","description":"\"The development team of miniature force plates used in measuring friction and adhesive forces on frog toe pads.\") (\"entity\"","source_id":"bea216e0fcc7f946f0033c137012a930"}],"entity_graph":"<graphml xmlns=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\/1.0\/graphml.xsd\">  <key id=\"d2\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"source_id\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d1\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"description\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d0\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"type\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <graph edgedefault=\"undirected\">    <node id=\"&quot;WJP BARNES&quot;&amp;&quot;W FEDERLE&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"ORGANIZATION\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"The development team of miniature force plates used in measuring friction and adhesive forces on frog toe pads.\") (\"entity\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">bea216e0fcc7f946f0033c137012a930<\/data>    <\/node>  <\/graph><\/graphml>"}

Such a change would of course also have reduced adhesion from viscosity-dependent hydrodynamic forces, and also molecular interactions (e.g. van der Waals forces) that depended on close contact of pad and surface. The experiment is, however, interesting, even though it did not confirm the dominant role of capillarity that it was intended to test. This is because it demonstrates another, equally Downloaded from https:\/\/royalsocietypublishing.org\/ on 09 July 2023\n\nimportant role for capillary forces in holding the pad close enough to the ground to allow the other forces to exert their adhesive action.\n\nA second interesting result resulting from single pad force recordings comes from the work of Federle et al. [23] in which friction forces were recorded during a short horizontal pull.\n\nSince friction forces developed before the pad began to slide and, additionally, there was a\n\n\u2018remaining\u2019 friction force 2 min after the slide was completed, it is clear that toe pads can generate static friction, strongly suggesting that, during such times, there is actual contact between structures on the toe pads (presumably the nanopillars) and the force plate.\n\nFinally, as has been made clear from the above, these miniature force plates are particularly suitable for measuring the maximum adhesive and friction forces that tree frog toe pads can produce, since both the maximum force and the area of contact are easy to measure. In the gliding frog, Rhacophorus dennysi, the calculated values were 1.45 \u00b1 1.14 mN mm\u22122 ( N = 33) for adhesive force and 6.21 \u00b1 5.11 mN mm\u22122 ( N = 24) for friction [17]. This result supports one of the main\n\n\n\n\n\nconclusions of Langowski et al. [16], that toe pads are optimally developed for friction rather than 13\n\nadhesion.\n\nr\n\n............................................................... oyalsociet 3.

CNT-based adhesives showed shear adhesion of approximately 100 N cm\u22122, 10 times higher than that of gecko foot-hairs [46]. The complicated fabrication process and the poor durability of CNT forest, however, hinder its future applications. By contrast, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which has a relatively low modulus, has been widely used to construct structured adhesives due to its handling simplicity and commercial availability.\n\nCompared to the flat surface, PDMS micropillar arrays showed a remarkable decrease in E eff, so that a larger AR results in a smaller E eff (figure 13 a, b). The decreased E eff results in a higher compliance to the contact surface, causing a higher elastic energy dissipation during pull-off from the surface [52]. For instance, increasing the AR of PDMS micropillar arrays from 0.5 to 4 increased pull-off forces by a factor of 3 [53]. It is worth mentioning that measurement of the E eff of a pillar array with a small AR (e.g. 0.5) could be influenced by its backing material. However, higher ARs are not always beneficial for adhesion enhancement. In the case of frog-inspired hexagonal pillars Downloaded from https:\/\/royalsocietypublishing.org\/ on 09 July 2023\n\nwith height of H and side length of L (figure 13 c), the adhesion force was found to decrease when H\/ L was increased from 0.75 to approximately 1.9 (figure 13 d) [54]. Similar adhesion dependence on the pillar AR was also reported by Iturri [55]. It was explained that the pillars tend to bend and cluster at a high AR, due to the small gap between pillars. The bending and clustering may contribute to the adhesion reduction in two possible ways: (1) the bending of pillars offers the pillar edge for contact, reducing the effective contact area; (2) the clustering of pillars may form a continuous area for contact, reducing the effect of contact splitting. Moreover, the contact density will be reduced by increasing the channel width W, resulting in a smaller adhesive force. This may explain why tree frog toe pads have a small pillar height and a small channel width.\n\nThough the adhesive toe pads on tree frogs and bush-crickets are normally called smooth adhesive

The increased friction force of this hierarchical hexagonal structure, especially in the hydrophilic state, demonstrated the importance of nanostructures on toe pads of tree frogs (figure 14 b). Moreover, concave, spatular, T-shape and spherical micropillar tops were also constructed to investigate the adhesion properties. T-shape pillars, prepared by conventional moulding [59] and inking\u2013printing\u2013curing (IPC) methods, exhibited maximum adhesion strength, both in wet [60] and dry [48, 61] conditions. Both the higher compliance and comparatively large contact area contribute to the outstanding performance. Furthermore, the crack initiation tends to start from the centre during the detachment [62], which results in a suction effect, contributing positively to the adhesion [59].\n\nDownloaded from https:\/\/royalsocietypublishing.org\/ on 09 July 2023\n\n(b) Influences of micro- and nanostructure\n\nInspired by the existence of nanopillars in toe pad of tree frogs, we fabricated a composite structure with aligned polystyrene (PS) nanopillars embedded in soft PDMS hexagonal micropillars [63]. Both adhesion and friction forces were greatly enhanced compared to the structure with pure PDMS. The finite-element simulation suggests that the embedded nanopillars could regulate the stress distribution across the contact interface, with the stress maximum being distributed on top of a row of nanopillars close to the micropillar perimeter (but not at the centre of contact area or at the very edge of the pillar; figure 14 d).

If the core is composed of a polymer material whose stiffness significant decreases by applying an electric current, dynamic tuning of adhesion was successfully realized by the modulation of subsurface stiffness [66].\n\n(c) Adhesion with liquid at interface\n\nThere is mucus on the toe pads of tree frogs, so that a thin layer of liquid is always present at the contact interface. Therefore, tree frog adhesion is considered as wet adhesion, compared to the dry adhesion of geckos. To mimic wet adhesion, spreading a layer of liquid on the structured surface is widely employed [60, 67,68].

By applying glycerol (which is polar and does not evaporate ran\n\nat room temperature) to the interface, the adhesion of structured PDMS against a ruby sphere s.R\n\nwas evaluated [60]. It was found that, in the main, short-range attractive forces dominate\n\n.So\n\nadhesion when the PDMS surface is hydrophobic, as the glycerol may be squeezed out from c.A37\n\nthe contact area forming direct contacts. It therefore behaves like gecko-inspired structured 7\n\nadhesive, showing a strong dependence on the contact geometry [60]. By contrast, long-range\n\n:20190131\n\nattractive forces associated with capillarity dominate when the surface is hydrophilic. In this situation, capillary force dominates the adhesion strength, independent of the microstructures on the surface. It was suggested that the adhesion enhancement in the presence of fluid could be the result of crack arresting by liquid, in addition to the capillary forces [69]. It should be noted that excessive liquid will produce a lubrication region, leading to a reduction in adhesion and friction [69,70]. Since the surface wettability has a strong influence on wet adhesion, the switching of a surface between hydrophilic and hydrophobic, e.g. by temperature, could therefore regulate the wet adhesion. By coating a layer of temperature responsive copolymer poly(dopamine methacrylamide-co-methoxyethyl acrylate-co-isopropyl acrylamide) (p(DMA-co-MEA-coNIPAAm) on PDMS micropillars, switching of underwater adhesion was successfully achieved by simply adjusting the temperature of the water bath (figure 15 b) [71].\n\nThe microstructure of the toe pads of animals like tree frogs is considered to play a very important role in wet adhesion.

Due to the polygonal nature of frog-inspired micropatterns, shear adhesion (friction) shows orientation dependence. In our previous work, wet friction was found to be the highest along the direction of side-sliding (figure 16 a) [55]. Moreover, elongated hexagonal micropillars show an even higher friction at the same orientation. The effective arresting of cracks increases following the edge density per unit length along the friction direction, contributing to friction Downloaded from https:\/\/royalsocietypublishing.org\/ on 09 July 2023\n\nenhancement. The theory was demonstrated by a macroscopic experiment, where the frog-inspired patterns were mounted on metal pieces and allowed to slide on a rotating surface covered with water (figure 16 c). However, Cheng et al. reported a contradictory result that the wet friction of corner-sliding was higher in both hexagonal and rhomboid pillar arrays [74]. Using Chinese ink as the indicator, the liquid squeezing out of the contact interface was found to be more effective in the direction of corner-sliding (figure 16 a). In the direction of side-sliding, liquid may flow into the contact interface due to the tilting of pillars and the flow pattern, resulting in decreased friction [74]. Recently, distinctive arch-shaped structures (figure 16 b) were reported to provide even larger wet friction force than tree frog-inspired hexagonal patterns, due to their optimal drainage effect and the high stiffness of the patterns [75]. This offers new possibilities for the design of wet adhesives in future.\n\nRecently, it was reported that the bioinspired wet adhesive exhibits better performance on rough than smooth substrates [76,77].

This means that capillary force may serve as the major contributor to wet adhesion on a rough surface [77]. Moreover, structured adhesives could effectively slow down the evaporation of liquid on the rough substrates, which is quite important for tree frogs and other animals using wet adhesion in their natural environment [38].\n\nWhile most studies of wet adhesion on artificial materials involved coating a thin layer of liquid on the structured surface, a few reported the delivery of liquid to the contact area mimicking the secretion of animals [49, 80]. Making use of the microphase separation of block copolymer poly(styrene- b-2-vinylpyridine) (PS2VP), nanopillars with 98 nm internal channels were designed to deliver liquid to the contact area, mimicking the dynamic secretion of animals.\n\nThe combination of material softening in high humidity and the transportation of mineral oil to the contact interface greatly increased the adhesion force by two orders of magnitude.

Thus, the friction force was double that of commercial products and stretched the moist skin much better. Also, Chen et al. prepared PDMS polygonal arrays and applied them to the gripping surface of surgical graspers (figure 18 b). Compared to the traditional tooth-textured surgical grasper, the new design can greatly reduce the gripping force, reducing damage to soft tissue [74]. More recently, a biomimetic skin patch inspired by the hexagonal pattern of tree frog toe pads and the convex cup of octopus suckers has been reported\n\n(figure 18 c) [83].

Significant progress has been made in recent years, both in our understanding of how tree frogs adhere and in the development of tree frog-inspired wet adhesives. But many questions remain unanswered. For instance, while\n\n.or\n\nmost of the tree frog-mimicking studies have focused on the micropattern on the toe pad, more g\/journal\/rsta\n\nattention should be given to forming a better understanding of the role of the nanostructures.\n\nCould there be synergistic interactions between the micro- and nanostructures and the mucus?\n\nMoreover, since the animals keep secreting all the time, the liquid volume at the contacting interface should change accordingly. How will this dynamic process contribute to adhesion and P\n\nfriction during the locomotion of animals? And can we make use of the dynamic process? The hil.T\n\nanswers to these questions could deepen our understanding of the adhesion of tree frogs and ran\n\nspeed the development of applications of bioinspired wet adhesion.\n\ns.R.\n\nData accessibility.
